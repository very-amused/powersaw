### Changed
- Section 6.5 now suggests adding resources to a store as soon as a non-stale version is available (verified by checksum), as opposed to ensuring the cache is up to date, then adding each resource from the cache
- Listing 14 has been redone to reflect the changes in Section 6.5, definitions have also been added so no unclear function/method calls remain
